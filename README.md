# MedicalBot_Using_GenAI

MedicalBot_Using_GenAI is a medical AI-powered chatbot that is capable of providing exact, real-time answers to medical queries. Created with the aid of Flask, the work leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing capabilities with the aid of the LangChain framework that incorporates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that fuses similarity-based document retrieval with generative models of language.

##Key features include:
###Vector Search & Embeddings: Leverages the usage of both Hugging Face embeddings and a Pinecone vector store to embed and serve contextually meaningful medical documents according to user queries.

###Advanced NLP Integration: Employs the OllamaLLM (deepseek-r1:1.5b) with tailor-made prompt engineering to generate rich, context-aware answers.

###Robust Response Processing: Applies regex-based output processing to clean and format the models' output to deliver clean and user-readable output.


###Secure & Modular Structure: Uses environment variables to manage sensitive API keys and is built with a modular code architecture to support ease of maintenance and scalability.


This project showcases the successful implementation of the latest generative AI technologies to healthcare, providing a novel solution to the delivery of real-time medical information.
